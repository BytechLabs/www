We don't just build software; we architect living systems. Our approach to system architecture is rooted in the
principles of resilience engineering. We assume failure is inevitable and design systems that degrade gracefully and
recover automatically.

# Capabilities

* **Microservices & Distributed Systems**: Decomposing monoliths into manageable, independently deployable services.
* **Event-Driven Architectures**: Building reactive systems that scale effortlessly with load.
* **Cloud-Native Design**: Leveraging the full power of AWS, GCP, and Azure without getting locked in.
